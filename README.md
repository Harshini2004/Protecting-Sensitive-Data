Protecting Sensitive Data with Encapsulation
This system is designed to securely manage patient records in a hospital. It follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring:
Patient names and record numbers can only be read (not modified) by hospital staff.
Medical history can be updated only by doctors.
Medical history changes require explicit approval before taking effect.
